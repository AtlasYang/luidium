<p align="center">The streamlined, platform-agnostic solution for deploying your cloud applications.</p>

## Get Started

[Luidium Cloud Service](https://app.luidium.com)

[Luidium CLI](https://github.com/AtlasYang/luidium-cli)

## Features

- Create applications to manage blocks. Blocks are modular components that encapsulate containerized instances, such as web servers, databases, and web clients.

- Build blocks using various templates or create your own. To deploy your instance, you need to provide a Dockerfile.

- Deploying a block publishes it to an accessible domain.

- Download the code to your local machine for seamless modification and development.

- Use the [Luidium CLI](https://github.com/AtlasYang/luidium-cli) to upload your code, automatically triggering the redeployment of your application on the server. This streamlines the development workflow, allowing you to focus on writing code and seeing the results quickly.

- Effortlessly add or remove collaborators from applications and blocks, enabling smooth collaboration.
