## Get Started

[Web application](https://luidium.com)

[Luid CLI](https://luidium.com)

## Features

- Easily design your application architecture using the **Luidium Blueprint** by arranging and connecting components such as Server Block, Web Client Block, and Database Block.

- Deploying the Blueprint automatically connects all the blocks and publishes them to an accessible domain, simplifying the process of linking databases to servers via drivers and connecting web clients to servers through endpoints.

- Download the code to your local machine for modification and development.

- Upload your code using the Builder CLI to automatically redeploy your application on the server.
